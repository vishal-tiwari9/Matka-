# Credence Protocol

**[Live Demo](https://credence-protocol.vercel.app/)** — no setup required. Note that the backend is running on a free version of Render, so you may get an error on your search as the server starts up. If this happens, wait about a minute and try again.

Onchain credit scoring and undercollateralized lending on BNB Chain. Credence blends two independent credit signals — onchain wallet behavior across 5 blockchains and ZK-verified offchain credit attestations — into a composite score that determines collateral requirements on a continuous curve. The result: creditworthy borrowers access capital-efficient lending terms that neither traditional finance nor existing DeFi protocols can offer alone.

**Credence applies battle-tested credit scoring methodology to onchain data for the first time, because the trillion-dollar lending market won't move to DeFi until DeFi can underwrite with the same rigor the real world does.**

No external API keys are required. For the full live-data experience, visit the deployed demo at [credence-protocol.vercel.app](https://credence-protocol.vercel.app/). To run locally without an Allium API key, the pipeline uses cached or synthetic data with full model inference. See [docs/TECHNICAL.md](docs/TECHNICAL.md) for details.
